  Intertechno library for the Arduino.

  This library implements the following features:

   - generate command sequences that once sent to an OOK rf stage are able 
   to control intertechno radio switches.

  you can get such a stage either by hacking an Intertechno remote control [1]
  or buy purchasing someting like 'Grove - 433MHz Simple RF link kit' [2]
  from Seeedstudio and using the TX module. that module has been tested and
  found to work well even at low (3.3v) Vcc levels.
