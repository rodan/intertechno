  Intertechno library for the Arduino.

  This library implements the following features:

   - generate command sequences that once sent to an OOK rf stage are able
   to control intertechno radio switches and doorbells.

  you can get such a stage either by hacking a factory remote control [1]
  or by using something like 'Grove - 433MHz Simple RF link kit' [2]
  from Seeedstudio. that TX module has been tested and found to work well
  even at low (3.3v) Vcc levels.

# 2024 update

  there are two [3] intertechno protocols in the wild now and the arduino lib only implements one of them. see my msp430 [4] that can interface with both.
